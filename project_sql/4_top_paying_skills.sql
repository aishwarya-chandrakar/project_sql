Big Data & ML Tools Pay the Most: Skills like PySpark, DataRobot, Pandas, and Scikit-learn dominate the top tier, reflecting demand for data processing and machine learning expertise.
DevOps & Collaboration Tools Are Invaluable: High salaries are tied to tools like Bitbucket, GitLab, Jenkins, and Airflow, showing the value of version control and workflow automation.
Cloud & Infrastructure Skills Boost Earnings: Knowledge of GCP, Linux, Kubernetes, and Databricks is well-rewarded, showing the trend toward cloud-based analytics.
Specialized/Niche Tools Stand Out: Tools like Couchbase, Watson, and MicroStrategy may not be mainstream but offer high salaries due to skill scarcity.
